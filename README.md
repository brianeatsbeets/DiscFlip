# DiscFlip
DiscFlip is a personal project to track records of disc purchases and sales. It was initially created to be an easy way for me to track and maintain records of disc sales and expenditures, but is evolving into a more generic book-keeping app. This will allow it to break out of a niche market and serve as a straight-forward record-keeping utility for casual buyers and sellers who don't want to mess with complicated, pricey bookkeeping software.

This project incorporates a variety of UIKit interactible elements and utilizes stack views and both static and dynamic table views. There are also some small animations to provide a fun, visual pop to certain processes.

Other features:
- Colored theme and styling
- Diffable data sources
- Input field validation
- Dynamic unwind navigation flow based on context
- Filterable table view
- Custom enlarged button "hitbox" to adhere to Human Interface Guidelines
